    "# Main\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "`main.py` implements the graphical user interface and game loop for a digital version of Jungle Chess (also known as Dou Shou Qi or Animal Chess), a traditional Chinese board game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constants and Configuration\n",
    "- Screen dimensions and layout settings\n",
    "- Colour definitions\n",
    "- Game state constants (MAIN_MENU, PLAYER_SELECTION, GAME)\n",
    "- Font initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "1. **JungleAnimals**: Represents animal pieces on the board\n",
    "   - Properties: color, type, image\n",
    "   - Methods to handle piece-specific behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Button**: Creates interactive UI buttons\n",
    "   - Properties: position, size, text, colors\n",
    "   - Methods for drawing, updating, and checking clicks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Screens\n",
    "The game has three main screens:\n",
    "1. **Main Menu**: Simple title screen with a play button\n",
    "2. **Player Selection**: Interface to choose player types (human or AI) for both sides\n",
    "3. **Game Screen**: The actual game board where gameplay happens\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Initialization\n",
    "- `init_board()`: Sets up the initial board state with all animal pieces in their starting positions\n",
    "- Configuration of player types (human, random AI, negamax AI, or alpha-beta AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawing Functions\n",

    "# aiPlayer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "`aiPlayer.py` defines three classes of AI players with increasing levels of intelligence:\n",
    "1. RandomPlayer (simplest)\n",
    "2. NegamaxPlayer (intermediate)\n",
    "3. AlphaBetaPlayer (most advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each class implements the `get_ai_move()` method, which analyzes the current board state and returns a move for the AI to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### RandomPlayer\n",
    "A basic AI that simply chooses a random valid move from all possible moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods**:\n",
    "  - `get_ai_move()`: Collects all valid moves for the current player and randomly selects one\n",
    "\n",
    "### NegamaxPlayer\n",
    "Implements the Negamax algorithm, which is a variant of the Minimax algorithm for zero-sum games.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods**:\n",
    "  - `get_ai_move()`: Entry point that evaluates all possible moves and selects the best one\n",
    "  - `negamax()`: Recursive implementation of the Negamax algorithm\n",
    "  - `get_all_valid_moves()`: Collects all valid moves for a player\n",
    "  - `make_temp_move()`: Creates a temporary board state after a move by manually copying piece references to avoid issues with Pygame surfaces\n",
    "  - `evaluate_board()`: Scores a board position based on piece values and positions\n",
    "  - `get_player_score()`: Calculates a player's score on the board\n",
    "\n",
    "### AlphaBetaPlayer\n",
    "The most sophisticated AI, implementing Alpha-Beta pruning (an optimization of the Minimax algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods**:\n",
    "  - `get_ai_move()`: Main entry point, similar to NegamaxPlayer but using alpha-beta search\n",
    "  - `alpha_beta()`: Recursive alpha-beta search algorithm\n",
    "  - `hash_board()`: Creates a string representation of the board state for the transposition table\n",
    "  - `get_all_valid_moves()`: Similar to NegamaxPlayer\n",
    "  - `make_temp_move()`: Creates a new board with moved pieces using direct assignment of references rather than deep copying to avoid Pygame surface serialization issues\n",
    "  - `evaluate_board()`, `get_player_score()`: Similar to NegamaxPlayer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Depth**: Both NegamaxPlayer and AlphaBetaPlayer use a search depth parameter to limit how far ahead they look, with deeper searches providing better but slower decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Board Evaluation**: Both advanced AIs use a heuristic function that considers:\n",
    "   - Piece ranks (higher-ranked pieces are worth more points)\n",
    "   - Proximity to the opponent's den (encouraging pieces to move toward winning)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transposition Table**: AlphaBetaPlayer uses a memory box (transposition table) to store previously evaluated positions, improving efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Random Factor**: Small random variations are added to evaluation scores to create some unpredictability and prevent deterministic play\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Manual Board Copying**: Both advanced AIs use manual reference copying instead of Python's deepcopy to handle Pygame objects properly\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negamax**: A variation of minimax that uses the property that max(a,b) = -min(-a,-b) to simplify the implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by stopping evaluation of a move when it's determined that the move will be worse than a previously examined move\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration\n",
    "The AI players use utility functions from `utils.py` to understand valid moves and implement game rules."

    "# utils\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "`utils.py` implements the rule set of Jungle Chess, including piece movement patterns, capturing rules, and victory conditions. It serves as the foundation of the game's logic without being tied to any specific UI or AI implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Constants\n",
    "- **RED_TRAPS**, **GREEN_TRAPS**: Coordinates of trap squares for each player\n",
    "- **RED_DEN**, **GREEN_DEN**: Coordinates of each player's den\n",
    "- **WATER_CELLS**: Coordinates of river/water squares\n",
    "- **ANIMAL_RANKS**: Dictionary mapping animal types to their power rankings\n",
    "- **DIRECTIONS**: Common movement directions (up, down, left, right)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions\n",
    "- **get_rank()**: Returns the numerical rank of an animal type\n",
    "- **get_adjusted_rank()**: Modifies a piece's rank based on special conditions (e.g., being in a trap)\n",
    "- **is_water_cell()**: Checks if a position is in the river\n",
    "- **is_valid_position()**: Determines if a move destination is valid (in bounds, not own den)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Movement Logic\n",
    "The file implements specific movement rules for each animal type:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **regular_moves()**: Standard movement for most animals (Cat, Dog, Wolf, Leopard)\n",
    "   - Can move one space orthogonally\n",
    "   - Cannot enter water\n",
    "   - Can capture lower or equal rank pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **rat_moves()**: Special movement for the Rat\n",
    "   - Can enter water\n",
    "   - Can capture elephants (special rule)\n",
    "   - Can only capture when not in water\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **elephant_moves()**: Special movement for the Elephant\n",
    "   - Cannot enter water\n",
    "   - Cannot capture Rats (special rule)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **jumping_moves()**: Special movement for Tiger and Lion\n",
    "   - Can jump across river in straight lines\n",
    "   - Cannot jump if a Rat is in the water between start and destination\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game State Evaluation\n",
    "- **get_valid_moves()**: Master function that returns all valid moves for a specific piece\n",
    "- **is_game_over()**: Checks win conditions:\n",
    "  1. Den occupation (a player's piece enters the opponent's den)\n",
    "  2. Elimination (all of one player's animals are captured)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Rules Implemented\n",
    "1. **Piece Hierarchy**: Each animal has a rank, and can generally capture lower or equal rank pieces\n",
    "2. **Special Cases**: \n",
    "   - Rat can capture Elephant despite being lowest rank\n",
    "   - Elephant cannot capture Rat\n",
    "3. **Trap Mechanics**: Any animal in an opponent's trap has its rank reduced to 0\n",
    "4. **River Crossings**: Only Rat can swim, while Tiger and Lion can jump across\n",
    "5. **Victory Conditions**: Enter opponent's den or eliminate all opponent's pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration\n",
    "This file provides the rule foundation that both the main game loop and the AI decision-making rely on. It ensures game rules are applied consistently throughout the application.\n"
